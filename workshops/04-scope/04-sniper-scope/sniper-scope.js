// Each of the functions in sniper-scope.js asks you to make a prediction: will
// AgentinScope be equal to true or false? The tests for this problem will pass if
// your prediction is correct. Note that the tests each of these functions in the
// same order in which they're defined in sniper-scope.js.

// It's best to get each test to pass before moving onto the next function. If you
// get a prediction wrong, try to understand the observed behavior before moving
// on.
